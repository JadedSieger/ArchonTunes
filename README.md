# ArchonTunes
ArchonTunes is an Open-Source C# based Music Player that uses Windows Media Payer as the immediate player.

# ArchonTunes : Overview

ArchonTunes is a sparked idea while I was watching Genshin Impact Content.
ArchonTunes aims to be a fully funtional Music Player with a number of features while being Programmed in a variety of Programming languages.
I actually want to put as much effort here as I can, and I appreciate if anyone would help out and give some tips and fixes.
This is the only full on project that I have ever worked on with a roadmap and such.

# ArchonTunes: RoadMap

1.0.2 : Newer Interface Design.

1.0.3 : UI Overhaul

1.0.4 : Fix to an unhandled Exception error that happens when playing certain songs.

1.0.5b: Ability to Chnage theme (Light/Dark Mode)
