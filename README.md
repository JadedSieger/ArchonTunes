# ArchonTunes
ArchonTunes is an Open-Source C# based Music Player that uses Windows Media Payer as the immediate player.

# ArchonTunes : Overview

ArchonTunes is a sparked idea while I was watching Genshin Impact Content.
ArchonTunes aims to be a fully funtional Music Player with a number of features while being Programmed in a variety of Programming languages.
I actually want to put as much effort here as I can, and I appreciate if anyone would help out and give some tips and fixes.
This is the only full on project that I have ever worked on with a roadmap and such.

# ArchonTunes: RoadMap

1.0.2 : Newer Interface Design. [Current Version]

1.0.3 : UI Overhaul

1.0.4 : Fix to an unhandled Exception error that happens when playing certain songs.

1.0.5b: Ability to Chnage theme (Light/Dark Mode)


# Installation and Running:

Click on setup.exe and accept, since this is a new app, Security Certificates are not requested as of yet, though I do encourage exercising caution, running mine should be no danger. Once the Setup finishes. You are freely able to play whatever song you desire.

In case when you have exited the app and want to reenter, simply open setup.exe again.
